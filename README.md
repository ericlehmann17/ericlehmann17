- Hi, Iâ€™m @ericlehmann17
- Iâ€™m interested in programming as well as sports, video games, investing, and the commercial tech world. 
- Iâ€™m currently learning front end development skills on my own (react.js), as well as programming methodology and other skills in college.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any projects that seem interesting! My personal skills are mainly in front end development, and I've picked up bits of backend knowledge through my coursework.
