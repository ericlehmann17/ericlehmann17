- 👋 Hi, I’m @ericlehmann17
- 👀 I’m interested in programming (obviously) as well as sports, video games, investing, and the commercial tech world. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front end development skills on my own (react.js), as well as programming methodology and other skills in college.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that seem interesting! My personal skills are mainly in front end development, and I've picked up bits of backend knowledge through my coursework. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... Email: lehmann.eric.j@gmail.com || LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/eric-lehmann-021701/
